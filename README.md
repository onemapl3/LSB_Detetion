# LSB_Detection
An Object Detection Project for Low Surface Brightness (LSB) Galaxies. [AlexeayAB](https://github.com//darknet#how-to-train-to-detect-your-custom-objects)'s respository was merged. <br/>If you have interests in how it works, try to read my research essay [A Way of Detection of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies](https://github.com/wannaAC/LSB_Detetion/blob/master/A%20Way%20of%20Detection%20of%20Low%20Surface%20Brightness%20Galaxies.pdf).<br/>If you have interests in Cloud Computing with Google Colab, see my [Jupiter Notebook](https://github.com/wannaAC/LSB_Detetion/blob/master/codes/YOLOv3_Colab.ipynb)<br/>The implemented codes (except for the framework itself) and results are in their directories, and it's easy to understand.<br/>Thank [AlexeayAB](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-train-to-detect-your-custom-objects) and [The AI Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10joRJt39Ns&t=371s) for their tutorials on YOLOv3 and Google Colab.<br/>*if you need fits resources for the project or weight files, try to contact me: fy9390218@foxmail.com*
